# Dual_ARM7_Fault_Detection_System
 The "Fault Detection System" project uses dual LPC2138 ARM7 microcontrollers to monitor temperature and pressure in CNG cylinders, aiming to prevent hazards through real-time alerts and automated shutdowns. Equipped with an LM35 temperature sensor, MPX4115 pressure sensor, HC-05 Bluetooth module, and safety components like buzzers and relays, this system continuously checks environmental thresholds. If limits are breached, it activates alarms, shuts down the CNG nozzle, and sends alerts to mobile devices, ensuring enhanced safety in industrial, automotive, and household applications.
